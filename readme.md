Cross-Browser Testing: Run tests across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Reusable Step Definitions: Modular step definitions and page objects for easy maintenance.
Reporting: Detailed HTML reports for each test run with screenshots for failed steps.
Scalable and Configurable: Easily update test configurations for different environments or test data.
Technology Stack
Java: Core language for test implementation.
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation.
Cucumber: For BDD-style test execution.
JUnit: Test runner integration with Cucumber.
Maven: Build and dependency management.

Prerequisites:

Java JDK 8+
